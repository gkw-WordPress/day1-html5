        This is a nav, it shows you the way. Kinda like google maps but it's fast and it takes 
        you where you need to go. So, I guess it's not like maps...

            Here is the section where I give you my reasons why it's so great.

        First of all, it loads fast. How fast, the speed of light if it was 95% slower. 
        Still fast as heck though! Like, do you know of anything that can move that fast? 
        Nothing- except this website! Second, it freaking beautiful! Like the majestic 
        corgi, see image below for an example of perfect evolution.
